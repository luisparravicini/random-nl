`bin/fetch_words.rb` Creates a list of words from the [Wiktionary Dutch Index](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Index:Dutch) and stores the information on disk.


`bin/random.rb` prints a random word from the list and tries to open the url to the entry (it uses `open` which is a macOS command).


The scripts require Ruby (tested with 2.6)
